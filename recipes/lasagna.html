    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and garlic, cooking for 5 minutes until softened. Next, add mince and brown thoroughly. Stir in tomatoes and sprinkle dried oregano over the mixture. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Preheat oven to 180°C and grease a medium ovenproof baking dish. Arrange ¼ of the Lasagna sheets on the base, trimming them as needed to fit.
Spoon 1/3 of the mince mixture over the Lasagna sheets and cover with a generous layer of béchamel sauce. Repeat the layering process twice more. Top the final layer of béchamel sauce with Lasagna sheets and spread the remaining béchamel over them. Sprinkle cheese over the top and bake for 30-40 minutes until the pasta is tender and cheese turns golden brown. If needed, cover the dish with foil during baking to prevent the cheese from burning.</p>
